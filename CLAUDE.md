    migrations/
      we don't edit them manually at all, instead we run npm run db:generate
    seed/
      this holds the seeding logic for testing it seeds a main admin user and a basic data set in all tables that shows how the entire system would work in real life for a past year or so, prefarable using faker but main focus is that data feels egypt related

## Key Entities

| Entity | Table | Admin Route | Public Route |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Case Studies | `case_studies` | `/work` | `/work`, `/work/[slug]` |
| Blog Posts | `blog_posts` | `/blog-posts` | `/blog`, `/blog/[slug]` |
| Services | `services` | `/services-mgmt` | `/services` |
| Testimonials | `testimonials` | `/testimonials` | Homepage section |
| Leads | `leads` | `/leads` | `/contact` form |
| Subscribers | `subscribers` | `/subscribers` | Homepage + blog forms |
| Users | `users` | `/users` | — |
| Branches | `branches` | `/branches` | — |

## User Roles

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| `admin` | Everything. Seeded as `root@gateling.com`. Cannot be deleted. |
| `employee` | Branch-scoped access (users, leads) |
| `customer` | `/my-account` — view own submitted leads |

## Architecture Rules

1. **Thin routes** — `page.tsx` composes the feature page only; business logic in features or server modules.
2. **tRPC for all data** — never fetch from DB in page components; use `api.*` from `@/integrations/trpc/server` or client hooks.
3. **i18n required** — every user-visible string must use `t('key')` with entries in both `*-en.ts` and `*-ar.ts` files.
4. **Server components first** — only add `"use client"` when hooks (state, effects) are needed.
5. **Bilingual EN + AR** — RTL via `dir` on `<html>`. Use `ms-*`/`me-*` (logical) not `ml-*`/`mr-*`.
6. **No `any`** — use `unknown` + narrowing, or inferred types from Zod/Drizzle.
7. **Build must pass** — run `npm run typecheck && npm run build` after any substantive change.
8. **Inngest for async** — any operation that does not require an immediate user response is offloaded to Inngest. See `docs/inngest-offload-policy.md`.
9. **Firebase for storage** — all image/asset uploads use `src/integrations/firebase/storage.ts`. No Cloudinary.

## Forms Pattern (TanStack Form)

- `useAppForm()` from `src/components/forms/hooks.tsx` — shared hook with Zod validation
- Field components: `EmailField`, `PasswordField`, `StringField`, `NumberField`, `DateField`, `SelectField`, `ImageField`
- Field components only support `useFieldContext()` — **never** `useFormContext()` inside leaf fields
- Zod error messages: i18n keys (e.g. `"forms.validation.required"`), not literal English strings
- Overlay forms: scrollable `OverlayFormBody` + fixed footer `OverlayFormSubmitButton` (see entity blueprint)

## Admin Entity Pattern

Run `/new-entity` to scaffold any new admin entity. The skill enforces the full blueprint including intake questions, all implementation layers, bilingual copy, and the Definition of Done checklist.

Canonical implementation reference: `src/features/system/users/` — read it before generating code for any entity.

Registry at `src/features/system/registry/entities.ts` is the single source of truth for capabilities.

## SEO Pattern

Every public page must have:
- Per-page `metadata` export (or `generateMetadata()` for dynamic routes) meta data should be available in both languages
- Title follows the site template: `%s | Gateling Solutions`
- OG image: `coverImageUrl` for dynamic content, `/og-default.png` for static pages
- JSON-LD on homepage: `Organization` + `WebSite`
- JSON-LD on case studies: `Article` schema
- See `docs/seo-blueprint.md` for full keyword targets and copy templates

## Inngest Background Jobs

See `docs/inngest-offload-policy.md` for the full policy.

Events fired:
- `lead/submitted` → email to `info@gateling.com` + auto-reply to visitor
- `subscriber/created` → confirmation email with unsubscribe link
- `case-study/published` → ping Google IndexNow
- `blog-post/published` → ping Google IndexNow + newsletter digest
- `user/registered` → welcome email (customer role gets Gateling intro)
- `lead/status-changed` → notify admin when lead becomes `qualified`

## Firebase Storage

Upload helper: `src/integrations/firebase/storage.ts` → `uploadImage(file, path): Promise<string>`

Used for: case study cover images, blog post covers, testimonial avatars, service icons.

## i18n Structure

Translation files co-located with the feature or page:
```
src/app/(landing-pages)/<page>/_translations/<page>-en.ts
src/app/(landing-pages)/<page>/_translations/<page>-ar.ts
src/features/core/i18n/global/en.ts   # shared keys (header, footer, common, forms)
src/features/core/i18n/global/ar.ts
src/features/<entity>/i18n/<entity>-en.ts
src/features/<entity>/i18n/<entity>-ar.ts
```
Every new user-visible string must appear in **both** `en` and `ar` files in the same change.

## Environment Variables

Server (`src/env/server.ts`):
```
# Database (one of these two forms)
DATABASE_URL                    # full postgres URL
DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME  # split config

# Auth
BASE_URL                        # e.g. https://gateling.com
JWT_SECRET_KEY                  # min 32 chars
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL_BASE

# Cache
REDIS_URL
REDIS_TOKEN

# Email
SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASSWORD
SMTP_SECURE, SMTP_FROM_EMAIL, SMTP_FROM_NAME

# Inngest
INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY

# Firebase Admin (server)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET

# WhatsApp
WAPILOT_INSTANCE_ID
WAPILOT_API_TOKEN
```

Client (`src/env/client.ts`):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
```

## Reference Projects (Success Stories)

These are Gateling's real client projects — reference them for seeding and content:

| Project | Path | public URL |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Atelier Alaa El-Kasry | `C:\Users\moham\OneDrive\Desktop\apps\atelier-management-system` | https://atelier.gateling.com/ |
| Gateling Cafe | `C:\Users\moham\OneDrive\Desktop\apps\gateling-cafe` | https://cafe.gateling.com/ |
| Megz Courses | `C:\Users\moham\OneDrive\Desktop\apps\megz-courses` | https://tms.gateling.com/ |

## Agent Workflow

- Run `/new-entity` before adding any admin entity — the skill enforces the full blueprint
- Read `docs/seo-blueprint.md` before adding any public page
- Read `docs/inngest-offload-policy.md` before adding any server mutation that involves email or external calls
- Quality gate: `npm run typecheck && npm run build` must pass after every substantive change
- Biome enforces sorted imports — run `npm run check:write` to auto-fix
- No `any`, no `@ts-ignore`, no hardcoded English user-visible strings
- RTL-safe: use logical CSS properties (`ms-`, `me-`, `ps-`, `pe-`) not directional (`ml-`, `mr-`)
